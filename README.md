A model to analyze regression and classification tasks using Neural Networks. The objective of the model is to accurately predict diabetes progression and classify data into different categories, utilizing the inherent structure of the implemented architectures and incorporating novel techniques. The network was trained on the Diabetes and Iris datasets and evaluated on separate test sets to assess its performance. The report describes the modified network architecture, the training process, and the evaluation results.
